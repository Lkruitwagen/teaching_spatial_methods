We'll use [PyProj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/) for coordinate reprojections, and [PySAL](https://pysal.org/) and [SPReg](https://pysal.org/spreg/) for spatial regression analysis. [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) will provide us with the json specification for spatial vector data.

    "Solar PV began growing very rapidly in the Netherlands in the late 2010s. The Netherlands is a small country with a complex urban-rural patchwork of land use. Previously, as in Kruitwagen et al. [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03957-7)], only 100m landcover products were globally available, however in 2021, three 10m global landcover products using Sentinel-2 data were published. Let's see how the different scale of these products impacts our measurement of the land cover impacts of solar PV installation. Specifically, let's use the [Copernicus CORINE Land Cover](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_CORINE_V20_100m#description) product for 2018 and the [ESA WorldCover](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_WorldCover_v100) product."
